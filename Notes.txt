Version 1.0.2
  - Better code commenting being added
  - Conversion to using player IDs with names to differentiate players better
  - Removed some 'reset-add' lottery settings that were not being used to simply settings more
  - Added several new values for lang.properties. It might be prudent to make a copy and move over that didn't change.
  - Commands will now have auto tabs to help make filling out the command arguments easier
  - Lotteries will auto update saved usernames  and switch them to their unique IDs. If they could not find the user or if there are multiple users with the same name, it will remove them and log out the error with the number of tickets and the lottery attached to the username.
  - Reward command will also check for mulitple users and will report an ambiguity error if multiple users exist with that name.
  - Also added the option for the reward command to check for an inputed UUID in place for the username. Can be easily found by googling and entering the player you are trying to find.
  - Added config setting 'default-op' for the option to set the default permissions for the admin commands.
  - Other general updates to 1.14
